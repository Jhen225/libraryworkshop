### Library Summer Workshop
The purpose of this project was to provide a local library with a solution to having to manually sort through a long list of participants by hand and place them into their choice of summer workshops. This was a learning experience for me because the use of angular for this application was bad choice due to the longer development process for an angular project and the fact that I was not familiar with the framework. The client ended up not using this due to a plethora of bugs that arose from my inexperience with the framework. Given the task to solve this problem today I would just build a simple website using basic html and css paired with javascript for dom manipulation.
