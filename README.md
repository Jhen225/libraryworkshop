### Library Summer Workshop
#### Goal 
The purpose of this project was to provide a local library with a solution to having to manually sort through a long list of participants by hand and place them into their choice of summer workshops. 
#### Pitfalls
This was a learning experience for me because the use of Angular for this application was bad choice due to the longer development process for an Angular project and the fact that I was not familiar with the framework. The client ended up not using this due to a plethora of bugs that arose from my inexperience with the framework. Even the use of React would have been a better choice due to the fact that I had prior experiences with the React framework.
#### Resolution
Given the task to solve this problem today I would just build a simple website using basic html and css paired with javascript for DOM manipulation.
